<h1>About Me</h1>
<p><img src="C:\Users\Patrick Hussey\Basic-Portfolio\assets\images\GasMask.png" alt="Patrick Hussey's Logo">My name is Patrick Hussey, but if you have made it this far you probably already knew that. I am a student/aspiring web devoloper studying at Georgia Tech Savannah. My goal is to become a full stack web devoloper, equally adept in both client and server related web devolopment. I would like to utilize my whole array of skills to create visually pleasing(or abrasive depending on situation) web-sites whose functions are as smooth and sleek as their apperance.</p>

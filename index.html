<h1>About Me</h1>
<img id="ima" src="C:\Basic-Portfolio\GasMask.png" alt="Patrick Hussey's Logo"><p>My name is Patrick Hussey, but if you have made it this far you probably already knew that. I am a student/aspiring web devoloper studying at Georgia Tech Savannah. My goal is to become a full stack web devoloper, equally adept in both client and server related web devolopment. I would like to utilize my whole array of skills to create visually pleasing (or abrasive depending on situation) web-sites whose functions are as smooth and sleek as their apperance.</p>
